# Machine-Learning-with-Python-IBM


## 📄 Summary 
This course provides an overview of the purpose of Machine Learning, and where it applies to the real world. It then covers topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and various useful Machine Learning algorithms. 

To explore the methods of machine learning, and the algorithms involved, many example projects are embarked upon and explored, including health care, banking, telecommunication, and so on.
The [final project](https://github.com/dattesh2507/Machine-Learning-with-Python-IBM/blob/main/Rain%20Prediction%20in%20Australia.ipynb) within this course is the building of a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day. It is a classification problem, and KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression are all used to determine the best algorithm to use.
